## A Blog-style Retrospective

This Week Me and [Justin](https://github.com/justin212407) collaborated on the Integration of the Engine with the Masonry. We worked on aligning the Engine's execution model with the Masonry's architecture, ensuring seamless communication and data flow between the two components.

---

## Goals for This Week

- Collaborate with Justin on the integration of the Engine with the Masonry.
- Identify potential challenges and solutions for the integration process.
---

## This Week's Highlights

- **Collaboration with Justin:**  
  Worked closely with Justin to align the Engine's execution model with the Masonry's architecture, ensuring seamless integration and communication between the two components.
- **Identifying Challenges:**  
  Identified potential challenges in the integration process, including data flow issues and synchronization concerns, and brainstormed solutions to address them.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Integration Complexity:**  
  The integration of the Engine with the Masonry presented challenges related to data flow and synchronization. To address these, we established clear communication protocols and data handling procedures between the two components.

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained insights into the intricacies of integrating different system components, particularly in terms of data flow and synchronization.
- Developed a better understanding of the Masonry's architecture and how it interacts with the Engine.
